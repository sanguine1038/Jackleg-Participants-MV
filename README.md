### -Building the game-
Just download RPG Maker MV and just go off through there.

It should also be of note that since I move the files from my own laptop to my PC that some files may not up to date. 

## -What you're allowed to do-
###  1. Take code for other RPG Maker MV projects.
 This includes the discussion tab code, only reason you're allowed to do that is because someone on reddit said they had the code for it and never shared it so to spite that person I'm leaving it here. SUCK IT u/DapperNachos EAT MY GIANT ENBY BALLS

### 2. Take the code for other YTTD projects.
  Gotta make sure that it gets everywhere to cuck DapperNachos.
 
### 3. Suggest better ways to format/code the game.
  I'm not one to say my code is super awesome and cool so if there are better ways to do it, please tell me.

## -What you're NOT allowed to do-
### 1. Taking credit from someone else.
  Say you've worked on this even though you have had 0 contact with the original developers. YALL AINT SLICK I SEE YOU. It does nothing but confuse people and you don't look any cooler for stealing someones work.
 
### 2. Repost the game on another website.
  The game files will forever ONLY be here, the website below and the YTTD Fan Wiki. If you guys see it anywhere else, it is likley either someone taking credit for it, or it's a virus.
  
## -Scripts-
Chapter 1-1 Script - [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZr6EGSm8yFUxB7u6lelh73EPIXs-4oFWQczQXYC1Wg/edit?usp=sharing)

### Additional Notes
* WORK ON YOUR OWN FAN STUFF, I LOVE PLAYING THEM ALL!! 
* This was all made by sanguine1038 (me) and I have no idea what I'm doing with GitHub so
if anything is out of place here just be paitent.
* READ THE WIKI!! NOW!
* Trans rights!

Love yourself.
