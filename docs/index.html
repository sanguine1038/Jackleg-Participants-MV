<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>High-schooler Ranmaru Kageyama wakes up in an unknown location, unable to remember how they got there, and is forced to do fatal tasks. Soon they realize he finds out he's trapped with another group of 9 people to participate in a death game. Nothing could prepare Ranmaru for what he's about to experience. With risks around every corner and unwelcoming bunch, some might say they're too clumsy to be in such a game.</p>
